# News and updates

**I have stopped maintaining this project. [Here's why](//github.com/Eloston/disable-html5-autoplay/issues/175#issuecomment-310616139).** However, I still welcome contributions (as pull requests) to the project. I recommend [rewriting the extension as version 0.7](//github.com/Eloston/disable-html5-autoplay/issues/114) because the code in 0.6 is hard to maintain. If you still want to make changes to the 0.6 series, you can do so in the `0.6-maintenance` branch.

**Google is now working on the autoplaying problem in the browser**. [Please see the Chromium issue report](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=715049) and the referenced design document for more details. There is discussion about this in [Issue #118](//github.com/Eloston/disable-html5-autoplay/issues/118).
